Joe 2 ideas

Magicians Name = Hue-dini.

Joe 2 - A pigment of your imagination.

Collect colour icons to colorise the world
Have a couple of bonus 'rooms' per level, similar to the world switching in joe 1.
Bonus room items will have to be collected in correct order to get maximum score.

Have joe be invincible for a couple of seconds when loosing a life/energy, just like a real game.

Have at least 4 worlds with 6 or so levels in each world.

Have acceleration for running (similar to gravity code).
Zoom in when running fast.

Platdude as wiseman again?

There is a being from outside of our world called a 'gamer' he helped you once before. Maybe he will again...

Platform cliches

- there will be an ice world. the floor will be slippery
- there will be a fire world, with chasms of lava to jump across
- there will be a forest world with thorns to avoid
- there will be platforms which disappear after walking over them
- it will take 3 hits to kill the boss 

A single level that, unlike the rest of the game, scrolls automatically in one direction at a constant speed, all the way through. (Variation on this: you die if you fail to keep up and touch the trailing edge of the screen.) 

100 collectibles = a new life!   

You can kill anything by jumping on it's head

will die if you fall into water, except in the water based level where you wont die. 

- Crates, crates, crates.
